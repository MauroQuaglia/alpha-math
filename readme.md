# alpha-math
Why alpha-math?
Because as **math** is the mathematics, **alpha** is the beginning... just as all the methods of this gem have been implemented, without the help of other gems but only with native Ruby methods. Look at my Gemfile!

# full reference
Visit the [wiki](https://github.com/MauroQuaglia/mathematicus/wiki) for the full documentation.

## getting started
Edit your Gemfile and add:
```ruby
gem 'alpha-math'
```
Now you can update your gemset with bundle.
